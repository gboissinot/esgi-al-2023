## Description
- DTO first implementation

## Notes
- A DTO has no business rules
- All DTO properties are accessible
- A DTO object is generally mutable after creation
- ScheduleMeetup1  : properties are private, getter/setters for all properties
- ScheduleMeetup2 : properties are directly public. We economize public getters/setters
- ScheduleMeetup3 : properties are directly public and we add public constructor to facilitate the object creation
